    <h1>MICROPLASTIC CONTAMINATION</h1>

          Microplastics are tiny plastic particles that result from both
          commercial product development and the breakdown of larger plastics.

          Microplastic particles ranging from 150 to 500 Âµm in size were the
          most predominant.A study shows that plastic debris is one of the
          dominant forms of marine litter and is estimated to reach 33 billion
          tonnes by 2050.
        </li>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <li>
          Once plastic debris enters the ocean, it degrades into smaller
          microplastic particles by photolytic, mechanical and biological
          degradation. These particles pose a risk to filter feeders, which
          often mistake the particles for plankton and consume them. Marine
          organisms from different trophic levels have been shown to ingest
          microplastics, and as a result, microplastic particles are estimated
          to have infiltrated the marine ecosystem.

          Microplastics have the potential to carry anthropogenic contaminants,
          which are released into the digestive fluids of marine organisms and
          ultimately infiltrate their tissues. This has potential impacts on
          human health through the consumption of contaminated marine organisms.

          Plastics are durable and cheap, leading to a rapid growth of the
          global plastics industry since the 1950s, with about 10% of waste
          plastics entering the ocean, accounting for 60-80% of marine waste,
          and even up to 90-95% in some areas. The main sources of microplastics
          in the ocean are land flow, coastal tourism, ship transportation, and
          fishing.
        </li>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <li>
          Microplastics in the ocean come from various plastic products and raw
          materials, such as polyurethane and polystyrene. The increasing demand
          for plastic products has dramatically increased the amount of plastics
          discharged into the ocean, leading to pollution and potential impacts
          on marine life and human health.

        <li>
          Microplastics are found in water bodies, beaches, and sediment, with
          high pollution levels in coastal waters due to human activity. The
          irregular shape and uneven surface of microplastics make them
          difficult to remove from the environment.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <li>
          The characteristics of microplastics vary depending on their type, and
          they often attach to other materials and are subject to environmental
          forces such as ocean currents.

          Marine microplastics can have toxic effects on fish and other aquatic
          life, including reducing food intake, delaying growth, causing
          oxidative damage and abnormal behavior. Nano-scale microplastics can
          penetrate biological barriers, accumulate in tissues, and affect life
          at the molecular level. Fish plays a key role in the marine ecosystem,
          and its health can affect the ecosystem's stability.

        <li>
          Moreover, marine pollutants can enter the human body by enriching in
          fish and threaten human health. Microplastics can inhibit growth and
          development, block the digestive tract, reduce energy reserves, and
          harm reproductive health. Polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene
          microplastics can cause oxidative damage and immunotoxicity. Research
          on the ecological effects of microplastics on fish is still limited
          but of great significance.

      <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
      <div class="p2">
        <p>
          Efficient removal of microplastics (MPs) from aquatic environments is
          critical in pollution control. Various technologies have been
          developed for MPs removal, such as coagulation, adsorption, magnetic
          separation, and membrane filtration, among others. Researchers have
          investigated the removal of MPs by water treatment technologies, such
          as coagulation, sand filtration, membrane filtration, and ozone
          oxidation. More than 90% of MPs can be removed through a series of
          water treatment processes. However, sustainability issues such as
          energy consumption and potential secondary pollution must also be
          considered.
