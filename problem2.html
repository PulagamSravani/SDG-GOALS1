    <h1>OIL SPILL</h1>
    <div id="box1">
      <p>
        Oil spills are a major threat to marine life, causing devastating
        effects on birds, mammals, fish, and shellfish. Exposure to oil can lead
        to hypothermia, poisoning, and other health problems, even making fish
        and shellfish unsafe for human consumption. Oil spills also disrupt the
        food chain by reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches plants and
        algae, leading to a decrease in fish populations and a reduction of
        oxygen in the water. Rehabilitation efforts are made to help affected
        wildlife, but the long-term impact of oil spills can be severe and
        damage coral reefs. Measures to prevent and respond to oil spills are
        crucial to protect the oceans and their inhabitants.

        <p>
          To prepare for future oil spills, governments and the oil industry
          must have preparedness plans in place and conduct regular spill
          response training exercises. The speed and preparedness of the
          response can minimize environmental impact. The cleanup process
          involves mechanical means such as using booms and skimmers to contain
          and skim the oil, but manual clean-up campaigns are typically required
          when the oil reaches the shoreline. Natural recovery can play a role,
          but restoration efforts are crucial to help the environment recover.
          Before restoration can begin, an understanding of the damage must be
          undertaken through ecological, biological, and chemical studies and
          analysis. The importance of restoration after an oil spill cannot be
          overstated.
