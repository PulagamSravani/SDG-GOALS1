        To prepare for future oil spills, governments and the oil industry must
        have preparedness plans in place and conduct regular spill response
        training exercises. The speed and preparedness of the response can
        minimize environmental impact. The cleanup process involves mechanical
        means such as using booms and skimmers to contain and skim the oil, but
        manual clean-up campaigns are typically required when the oil reaches
        the shoreline. Natural recovery can play a role, but restoration efforts
        are crucial to help the environment recover. Before restoration can
        begin, an understanding of the damage must be undertaken through
        ecological, biological, and chemical studies and analysis. The
        importance of restoration after an oil spill cannot be overstated.

        Efficient removal of microplastics (MPs) from aquatic environments is
        critical in pollution control. Various technologies have been developed
        for MPs removal, such as coagulation, adsorption, magnetic separation,
        and membrane filtration, among others. Researchers have investigated the
        removal of MPs by water treatment technologies, such as coagulation,
        sand filtration, membrane filtration, and ozone oxidation. More than 90%
        of MPs can be removed through a series of water treatment processes.
        However, sustainability issues such as energy consumption and potential
        secondary pollution must also be considered.
